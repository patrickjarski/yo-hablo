# Yo hablo.

This app is intended to help you practice conjugating verbs, we'll see how will it go.

There's 3 modes that you can practice conjugating the verbs with:

1. `Conjugate`
2. `Fill in the blank`
3. `Flashcards`

### Built with:

1. [Verbs JSON](https://github.com/ghidinelli/fred-jehle-spanish-verbs) - around 600+ spanish verbs.
2. [Landing page graphic](https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/languages-concept-illustration_63060930.htm#fromView=keyword&page=1&position=0&uuid=2f67f75d-588c-4baf-a2b3-4eba4e3a93c4&query=Languages?log-in=email)

| -    | Introducing MUI                     | No particular reason, tbh I feel like this is definitely overengineering, but I just wanted to practice using the lib a bit                                   |
| -    | 3 modules idea                      | The app's primary purpose is to help using verbs fluently, and correctly conjugated, thus Conjugate, Flashcards and Fill in the blank modules were introduced |
